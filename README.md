## Morning Route
No longer am I a slave to google maps, every morning I receive a notification telling me which highway is faster and how long my drive will take. I am currently revamping the UI and plan on an Android release soon in the future, for the time being I have included the Android app file in the repository root. If you would like to test the application simply download the MorningRoute.apk to your Android and install.
